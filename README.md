### Code Refactoring Plan

Violet is my first mobile app project.
Since I started without knowing anything, I didn't even know basic concepts like state management, so the code is very dirty.
I have plans to refactor all my code until 2.0.0 version using bloc and provider etc.

### Multiple Language Support

If you want to add your language to the app,
please translate https://github.com/project-violet/violet/blob/dev/assets/locale/en.json.
I can translate it by google translator, but the quality is low.

Thanks for translation

```
Italiano - https://github.com/AlexZorzi
中文-简化字 - https://github.com/casteryh
Español - https://github.com/Culombiano
```

If you want to support language in source code, please refer to the following commits.
